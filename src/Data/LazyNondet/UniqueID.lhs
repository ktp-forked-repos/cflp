Non-deterministic computations need a supply of unique identifiers in
order to constrain shared choices.

We provide an overloaded operation `withUnique` to simplify the
distribution of unique identifiers when defining possibly
non-deterministic operations. Non-deterministic operations have an
additional argument for unique identifiers. The operation `withUnique`
allows to consume an arbitrary number of unique identifiers hiding
their generation. Conceptually, it has all of the following types at
the same time:

    Nondet m a -> ID -> Nondet m a
    (ID -> Nondet m a) -> ID -> Nondet m a
    (ID -> ID -> Nondet m a) -> ID -> Nondet m a
    (ID -> ID -> ID -> Nondet m a) -> ID -> Nondet m a
    ...

We make use of type families because GHC considers equivalent
definitions with functional dependencies illegal due to the overly
restrictive "coverage condition".
